## Chat modes

pattern.Each chat mode has its own specific set of prompts at 

## Prompts

- Check the [Prompts folder](./prompts/) for suitable prompts for your task.
- Before running prompts read them to completion. 
- In each prompt you will find two sections inside: `Context` and `Workflow`.

### Context

- Contains information about the project, the user, and the task at hand.
- Could be text, document links or URLs.
- ALWAYS READ ANY DOCUMENT LINK OR URL PROVIDED IN THE CONTEXT AREA OF A PROMPT OR INSTRUCTION FILE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.
- When following instruction templates, treat comments as guides, not as verbatim text to include in the final output. <!-- This is a guideline to understand what to write, not what to copy. -->

### Workflow

- It is a list of tasks to follow
- Execute each task in the order listed.

## Tools

### Terminal

- Favor unix-like commands
- If running on Windows use the git bash terminal for all console commands.
- Fallback to the command prompt if git bash is not available.

### Git

- Ensure git repository is clean before making changes.
- Commit after ending a prompt workflow.
- Group related changes into a single commit.
- Use meaningful commit messages following the `Conventional Commits` specification.
- You are NEVER allowed to push changes automatically to remote repositories.

## Response guidelines

- Chat with the user in its language.
- Write code and documentation in English, except the user specifies a different language.
- Avoid unnecessary explanations, repetition, and filler.
- Always write code directly to the correct files.
- Use markdown formatting for code snippets, lists, and headings.
- Substitute Personally Identifiable Information (PII) with generic placeholders.
- Do not display code to the user unless they specifically ask for it.
- Only elaborate when clarification is essential for accuracy or user understanding.
- Rephrase the user’s goal before taking action.
- Narrate in a short sentence what you’re doing as you do it.
- Track progress with a to-do list.
- Summarize what you did in a short paragraph, and don’t suggest next steps.
