# PRD ‚Äî AskBot CLI

## 1. Executive Summary

An educational CLI that queries public APIs to provide basic information about the user's IP and associated services: location, weather, currency, time, and sun data. The goal is to present students with a working terminal program that demonstrates consuming external services and handling JSON data.

### 1.1 Goals and Metrics

- Build a functional CLI application with all commands operating locally.
- Demonstrate successful consumption of public, free REST APIs.
- Implement error handling for external services that may be unavailable.

### 1.2 Audience

- Students: to gain hands-on experience consuming APIs.
- Instructors: to use as a guide and assess learning.

### 1.3 Technologies
- Language: Java 21
- Libraries: Minimal, preferably no extra frameworks.
- Tools: Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
- Deployment: Executable via `java -jar <jar-name>.jar`.

## 2. Scope

- Included: CLI with 4 main commands to query geolocation, weather, currency, and solar data.
- Excluded: Graphical interface, data persistence, authentication, notifications.

### 2.1 User Stories

- As a user, I want to know my current location based on my IP.
- As a user, I want to know today's forecast for my city.
- As a user, I want to see my country's official currency and basic exchange rates.
- As a user, I want to know sunrise and sunset times.

### 2.2 Functional Requirements

1. RF-1: `loc` or [empty] ‚Äî Shows city, country, latitude/longitude obtained from ipapi.co or ip-api.com.
2. RF-2: `weather` ‚Äî Shows current temperature, chance of rain, and weather code from open-meteo.com.
3. RF-3: `money` ‚Äî Shows the official currency of the country and exchange rates to EUR/USD/GBP/CHF from frankfurter.dev.
4. RF-4: `sun` ‚Äî Shows sunrise and sunset times from open-meteo.com.

### 2.3 Additional Functional Requirements

5. RF-5: `askbot help` ‚Äî Displays help with a list of available commands and descriptions.
6. RF-6: `askbot --version` ‚Äî Shows the application's current version.
7. RF-7: All commands must handle connectivity errors and show informative messages.

### 2.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- Simplicity: Prioritize clarity and simplicity in implementation and usage.
- Performance: CLI responses should be fast, preferably under 1 second with an active connection.
- Availability: Gracefully handle unavailability of external services.
- Usability: Intuitive commands and clear, useful error messages.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria and Risks

### 4.1 Acceptance Criteria

- Each command returns readable, structured text data.
- The CLI can be run from the terminal without errors.
- Connectivity and API unavailability are handled appropriately.
- Commands respond within 3 seconds under normal conditions.
- The application shows clear help messages when executed without parameters.

### 4.2 Risks

- External APIs not available: implement friendly fallback messages.
- API usage limits: inform the user about possible restrictions.
- Network connectivity: handle timeouts and connection errors gracefully.
- API changes: public APIs may change structure without notice.
